         <h2>Welcome to OYSCONME — We believe in Quality Teaching &amp; Practices </h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-8 text-justify">
                      <p>It is my privilege to welcome the aspiring and returning students to Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery, Eleyele, Ibadan, Nigeria which has created its own fame during the last 7 decades. Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery Eleyele, Ibadan ensures high quality professional education through various innovative programmes keeping ‘A’ grade in position among other colleges of Nursing in Nigeria. The College has a long history of providing quality nursing education fostered by visionary and committed leadership. I feel honoured to be given the opportunity to lead the College in this phase of its development.</p>
                      <p>In recent years the College has seen significant expansion both in the number of nursing students and lecturers and in the teaching facilities. The facilities now include a state of the art skills laboratory, with a range of patient simulators which allows students to develop and practice skills in a safe environment. New classrooms and lecture theatres, as well as recreational and study spaces have been added.</p>
                      <p>Building on the successes and academic excellence that has been achieved to date, the future focus of the College will continue to be the development of nursing knowledge through scholarship and research, the application of that knowledge to deliver nursing education that contribute to improving health care outcomes. As Basic Nursing and Post – Basic Midwifery students, you have chosen to be part of the largest group of health care professionals in Nigeria and World at large. With the developing complexity in health care delivery, nursing careers have become more flexible, diverse and rewarding. Nurses are taking on new and enhanced roles such as, clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, nurse consultant and independent nurse prescribers. We aim to educate nurses who are competent to deliver the best quality care in a range of settings and who will become future leaders, contributing to the advancement of healthcare and of the profession of nursing</p>
                      <span>With the current international shortage of qualified nurses, a range of job opportunities are available nationally, regionally and internationally.</span>
                      <p>My vision is that the College will be continually recognized locally, regionally and internationally for providing excellence in nursing education through innovative programmes that are responsive to global health challenges and for generating high quality interdisciplinary and international research. Achieving this vision will only be possible when the whole college community, including the students is committed to it. We will therefore strive to foster a student centered culture, where the students are our top priority and opportunities are afforded for students to engage in our vision and development. Whilst we will continue to challenge our students to enable them to achieve their full potential and to maintain academic standards, we will continue to strive to work with students in a supportive, sensitive and respectful manner.</p>
                      <p>You have come not by chance but chosen by God Almighty and hard work to the college. I can assure you that you are going to become a part of a high- spirited college with continuous learning. In the journey of achieving excellence, students are active partners. The College will impact your life forever. The teachers are involved in teaching, counseling and research work. They guide and assist the students in developing and refining their individual skills. I wish you Best of Luck! Thank you for your interest in studying at Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery.</p>
