                      <p class="text-justify">The Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery was formerly known as Oyo State School of Nursing which was established in 1949 and sited at the Old Army Barracks in Eleyele, Ibadan while Oyo State School of Midwifery was established in 1954 at Yemetu. The School of Nursing Eleyele was the first School of Nursing in Nigeria and it trains student nurses that provide nursing care for the citizenry in rural and urban areas either at primary, secondary or tertiary level of health care settings. The two schools have been training nurses and midwives since their inception contributing their quota to human development and standardized health care delivery. On August 24, 2005 the two schools namely; Oyo State School of Nursing, Eleyele and Oyo State School of Midwifery, Yemetu, Ibadan was merged together through an enabling act of Oyo State House of Assembly. As a result of this, there was institutional transformation which culminated the two schools becoming what is known today as Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery Eleyele, Ibadan. The former Governor of Oyo State, His Excellency Senator Rasheed Adewolu Ladoja, upgraded the two schools to a College and in 2005; His Excellency graciously signed into law the bill to that effect. The College is now faced with challenges of expanding the scope of training, injecting vitality into academic programmes and increasing human resources and streamlining the courses in the College, in line with what is obtainable in other Polytechnics and Colleges of Nursing and Midwifery in Nigeria. The School was elevated to a College of Nursing and Midwifery in August, 2005 through Oyo State of Nigeria Gazette No.19, Vol. 30 and by the Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery Law, 2005. The elevation was actualized by the present Administration under the able leadership of the tireless and indefatigable Senator Abiola Ajimobi, the Executive Governor when the College took off formally in 7th March, 2014. The College has a satellite campus named School of Midwifery located in Kishi. The school offers Basic Midwifery

                        <br><br>The Motto of the college is “Enhancing Quality Nursing Care and Safe motherhood”.</p>

                      <p class="text-justify">Nursing is an art and a science. The art components incorporate interpersonal skills, and embody certain values,

                        benefits and standards unique to nursing. The science component involves the development of cognitive and technical

                        skills required for nursing practice. The beginning nurse must be proficient in both the art and science of nursing which

                        are critical for professional development of nurses. Congruent with this belief, mission and vision, the nursing program

                        offers sound, flexible and accessible nursing education for committed young men and women pursuing a certificate in

                        general Nursing (RN). Oyo State College of Nursing and Midwifery considers the person, environment, health and nursing

                        to form the framework of nursing practice. A person, human being is a unique holistic individual by virtue of his/her development

                        and life experienced by two (2) interrelated forces, the internal and external environments.

                        The environment includes all of the conditions surrounding and affecting the person. The family is a strong system that can

                        greatly impact the well – being of the individuals. Other system affecting an individual includes the social and health care system,

                        culture, community and world. Any alteration in these will result in change in homeostasis of an individual. Modifying the environment

                        therefore is a crucial work that nursing caters for. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well –being and not merely

                        the absence of disease or infirmity. Nursing is a system requiring advanced knowledge and skills. The focus of nursing care is the client,

                        which comprises of an individual, group, family, population, or community. Nurses meet diverse health care needs of clients through

                        health promotion, disease prevention, illness and disease management, rehabilitation and providing care, and in doing this, the nurse,

                        integrates theory, research and knowledge from various disciplines. The world is dynamic and changing, and this necessitates that

                        nurses should be engaged in constant learning in order to provide excellent nursing care.</p>
